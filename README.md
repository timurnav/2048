# 2048
I've just tried to clone all known game 2048

run /2048/first.jar (for windows run RUN.but ibid) for playing

It's a console version, Keyboard observer takes singnals from keyboard.
To insert a field dimmensions, press appropriate buttons on keyboard.
When the focus of console will be lost, the game will be closed.
but when the game will start again, it would be continued.
